*Modules for Marksman Snipers will come on Dorothy's Vision update, and this is my theoretical overview on this.*

## I. In-depth for each module

1. Vermeil **(MAR-X)**

| Level | Attributes | Trait | Talent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 (No module) | N/A | Attacks aerial enemies first | Improves own Skill Point recovery rate by **+0.3/second** *\[+0.0\]* |
| 1 | HP **+90**, ATK **+23** | Attacks aerial enemies first. When attacking aerial enemies, increase ATK to **110%** | Improves own Skill Point recovery rate by **+0.3/second** *\[+0.0\]* |
| 2 | HP **+140**, ATK **+28** | Attacks aerial enemies first. When attacking aerial enemies, increase ATK to **110%** | Improves own Skill Point recovery rate by **+0.35/second** *\[+0.05\]* |
| 3 | HP **+170**, ATK **+31** | Attacks aerial enemies first. When attacking aerial enemies, increase ATK to **110%** | Improves own Skill Point recovery rate by **+0.4/second** *\[+0.1\]* |

Honestly I haven't built Vermeil so this is pretty hard to judge fairly. Her skillset is fairly simple: one simple up-ATK skill and one spray skill. For a 4-star, there is nothing much to speak on either skill - her base ATK is quite on the low side due to her rarity, and with only raw damage to compete, she quickly falls on the weak side of the sniper roster, maybe even to her other 4-star counterparts.

The trait buff of MAR-X purely focuses on striking down air targets. This should help when poking down tough drones (i.e. Raptor) - when the base ATK of snipers sometimes might not keep up well.

The talent buff doesn't really do much when taking numbers into consideration. Let's have a quick look at the windup time required:
- S1M3 (10/35):
    - mod1: 19.23s (*-0.00s*) first uptime, 26.92s (*-0.00s*) afterwards.
    - mod2: 18.52s (*-0.71s*) first uptime, 25.92s (*-1.00s*) afterwards.
    - mod3: 17.86s (*-1.37s*) first uptime, 25.00s (*-1.92s*) afterwards.
- S2M3 (10/20):
    - mod1: 7.69s (*-0.00s*) first uptime, 15.38s (*-0.00s*) afterwards.
    - mod2: 7.41s (*-0.28s*) first uptime, 14.81s (*-0.57s*) afterwards.
    - mod3: 7.14s (*-0.55s*) first uptime, 14.29s (*-1.09s*) afterwards.

Not too impressive actually. Given her usual windup is already good, this module just adds more icing on top.

Of course, no modules are bad actually (since they don't take anything from the operators, just add up more), so if needed, building her module is still welcomed, however there are virtually every better option available.

Personal rating:

| Level | Attributes | Trait | Talent | Overall |

| 1 | C+ | C | N/A | C |
| 2 | C+ | C | C | C |
| 3 | C+ | C | C | C |
